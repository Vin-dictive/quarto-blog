## Do You Have a Database? Want Predictions Without Data Scientists?

Do you have a database? Do you want to make predictions without the hassles of having data scientists? I got you covered!

## Introduction & Motivation

Most real-world data lives in relational databases. These are systems that organize information into tables, like spreadsheets, which can be linked together using keys - like connecting a "Customers" table with an "Orders" table.

**Pain points in data science:**

- ML models expect flat tables
- Relational data is complex and interconnected
- Better approaches are needed to reduce manual data preparation and speed up ML workflows

## Relational Data Basics

A relational database consists of tables, rows, and columns, with primary keys and foreign keys connecting tables.

**Examples of real-world relational data:**

- Customers, orders, products
- Users, events, transactions
- Databases have inbuilt graph charts explaining relationships between tables

## Traditional ML Workflow on Relational Data

**Manual data preparation steps:**

- Writing joins
- Aggregations and feature engineering
- Flattening data into a single table
- Data is spread out and not easy to track

**Problems with this approach:**

- Time-consuming
- Error-prone
- Highly specific to one schema

## The Core Challenge

Each database has a different schema. Models and pipelines often break when schemas change. Reusing models across organizations or datasets is difficult.

## New Approach: Database-Agnostic Modeling

**High-level idea:** build models that learn directly from relational structure.

**Key goals:**

- Avoid manual joins
- Reduce schema-specific logic
- Generalize across different databases

## How This Works (Conceptually)

A concrete example of this approach is **KumoRFM**, a relational foundation model built for predictive tasks on structured data.

Instead of requiring manual feature engineering or separate models for each task, KumoRFM represents tables and their foreign‑key relationships as a temporal, heterogeneous graph. Each table row becomes a node, and relationships between tables become edges.

![Graph Representation](placeholder-graph.jpg){fig-alt="Relational data represented as a graph structure"}

It uses a **Relational Graph Transformer** architecture, which performs attention across the graph to integrate information from related tables and capture complex multi‑table patterns in the data.

### Graph Transformers in Action

Graph transformers are a powerful architecture that extends the transformer model (famous from GPT and BERT) to work with graph-structured data. While traditional transformers work on sequences (like sentences), graph transformers can process nodes and edges in a graph.

**Where else are graph transformers used?**

- **Social Networks:** Predicting user behavior and connections on platforms like Facebook or LinkedIn
- **Drug Discovery:** Modeling molecular structures where atoms are nodes and bonds are edges
- **Traffic Prediction:** Understanding road networks where intersections are nodes and roads are edges
- **Recommendation Systems:** Connecting users, products, and interactions in e-commerce platforms

When a predictive query is submitted, KumoRFM extracts context examples from historical subgraphs relevant to the task and applies in-context learning at inference time, generating predictions without task-specific training.

This allows the model to handle different schemas and task types directly, essentially learning relational structure and semantics once and applying that knowledge broadly.

## Advantages of This Approach

- **Less feature engineering** - No more manual SQL queries and aggregations
- **Faster experimentation** - Test ideas quickly without data prep
- **More scalable ML pipelines** - Works across different databases
- **Easier deployment** - One model for multiple use cases

## Challenges and Tradeoffs

- Computational complexity
- Interpretability of learned representations
- Performance versus domain-specific features
- Integration with existing data infrastructure

## Implications for Data Science

This approach shifts the role of data scientists from feature engineering to problem framing. Similar to foundation models in other domains (like GPT for text or DALL-E for images), it points toward the future of ML on structured data.

**The transformation:**

- **Before:** 80% time on data prep, 20% on modeling
- **After:** 20% time on data prep, 80% on insights and decisions

## Conclusion

Database-agnostic ML reduces friction between relational data and modeling. Solutions like KumoRFM show that this approach is possible and practical today.

**Key takeaway:** Leveraging relational structure directly allows faster, more robust predictions across diverse databases. This means businesses can unlock the full value of their relational data in a way that is fast, reliable, and scalable.

As a result, this shift transforms the role of data scientists from manual feature engineering to higher-level problem formulation and decision-making.
