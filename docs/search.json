    "section": "The Challenge with Relational Data",
    "text": "The Challenge with Relational Data\nMost companies store their data in relational databases. These are systems that organize information into tables, like spreadsheets, which can be linked together using keys - like connecting a “Customers” table with an “Orders” table. While this structure is great for storing large amounts of data efficiently, it can be challenging when you want to use machine learning to make predictions or gain insights.\nTraditionally, machine learning models expect all the data in a single, flat table. This means analysts have to manually combine tables, calculate summary statistics, and create new “features” from the raw data. This is a process that is very time consuming, error-prone, and specific to each database. If a database changes even slightly, the model may break, and all the work has to be redone - fyi job of the data scientist.\n\n\n\nData Science Pipeline"

    "text": "Graph Transformers: Beyond Databases\nGraph transformers are a powerful architecture that extends the transformer model (famous from GPT and BERT) to work with graph-structured data. While traditional transformers work on sequences (like sentences), graph transformers can process nodes and edges in a graph.\nWhere else are graph transformers used?\n\nSocial Networks: Predicting user behavior and connections on platforms like Facebook or LinkedIn, where users are nodes and friendships are edges\nDrug Discovery: Modeling molecular structures where atoms are nodes and chemical bonds are edges, helping researchers predict drug properties\nTraffic Prediction: Understanding road networks where intersections are nodes and roads are edges, enabling better route planning\nRecommendation Systems: Connecting users, products, and interactions in e-commerce platforms to suggest relevant items\nKnowledge Graphs: Organizing and reasoning over facts and relationships, like Google’s Knowledge Graph\n\n\n\n\nGraph Transformer Visulization"

Think of it as a large language model but for structured business data instead of text. KumoRFM represents tables and their relationships as a graph, where each row is a point (node) and connections between tables are lines (edges). Using a graph transformer, the model can automatically learn patterns and relationships across tables, so it understands the structure and meaning of the data.\n\n\n\nKey capabilities of RFM"
